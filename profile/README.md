# Hyperion Foundation

Welcome to our Github Organization. This is the place where we put our coding-related projects. We always want to share what we made for our community.

We also have Discord servers. If you interested to join our community, you can join our Discord servers.
- [Hyperion Foundation](https://discord.gg/4U4k6bW) - This is the place where we chat and talk to our members casually.
- [Hyperion Store](https://discord.gg/SBaew54) - This is the place where we sell something to our customers.
- **Hyperion Lab (Server Archived)** - Previously, this was the place where we test our projects, but now, the server has been archived. Every project updates will be informed on the [Hyperion Foundation](https://discord.gg/4U4k6bW) Discord server.
